## About the documentation

The API documentation is generated using Swagger, a powerful yet easy-to-use suite of API developer tools for teams and individuals, enabling development across the entire API lifecycle, from design and documentation, to test and deployment.

## Postman Documentation

In addition to the Swagger documentation, we also provide a comprehensive Postman documentation for the **Nest-Auth-Prisma-Postgres** REST API.
Our Postman documentation includes a collection of about **160 tests** that cover all the API endpoints. These tests serve as a valuable resource for understanding the expected request and response patterns and for validating the functionality of the API.
